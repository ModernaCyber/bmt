BMW dashboard warning lights should not be taken lightly. It's important to familiarize yourself with this guide.
#### RED 
You Should pull over as soon as it is safe and call for roadside assistance, as you may have a serious problem with your car.
#### YELLOW
Then this means that an action is required, and it is recommended that you book a service with an authorised repairer at any recognized BMW dealerships.
#### GREEN
This is simply information and does not require immediate action, although you should keep an eye on them.
