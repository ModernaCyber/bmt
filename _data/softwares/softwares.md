## BMW Software

##### Jochen Kurbjuweit
"Our cars today have 50 to 60 computing units, including some high-performance computers, that regulate and measure everything from the navigation system to the steering wheel. Itâ€™s a complex system of various vehicle functionalities, which naturally benefit from constant improvements to keep the car fresh and up-to-date.
"

"Software and the ongoing maintenance of code has become a staple of modern life. We are used to software being everywhere we look and we try to take care of it like other important aspects of everyday living.
