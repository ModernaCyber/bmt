Is a BMW truly everything that it’s advertised to be? All bmw models [ BMW i8,BMW i4 M50 , BMW M135i, BMW M240i xDrive Coupé , BMW M235i xDrive Gran Coupé , BMW 3 Series Sedan M Models, BMW 4 Series Coupé M Models, BMW M440i xDrive Gran Coupe] serves up, stand-out attributes which separate it from the other models, but there are bound to be areas where BMW isn't the right choice.
At the end of the day, luxury and performance-based brands will inevitably exist to compete with one another. But what sets BMW clearly apart from the likes of Italian and British competitors are the attributes which embrace everything about Bavarian automotive philosophy. Whereas Italian automakers such as Alfa Romeo romanticize form, and Jaguar takes a (very British and) cool approach to function, BMW takes a different approach. Precise. Calculated. Diligently Executed. BMW takes the engineering in its most clinical sense and elevates it to an art form.


## Pros
Bmw cars are extremely engineered well making them very safe car, the cars are fun as well. The engine can easily go 300k miles.
Perhaps this is what makes the title of ‘Ultimate Driving Machine’ so easy to accept. A BMW makes no secret of being a machine. Come to think of it, why would it aspire to be anything less than automotive perfection? But in its execution, it transcends to become something else entirely. Boiled down to basics, here are some of the reasons why a BMW is worth considering.
 

### 1. Performance
This is the constant throughout the entire lineup, whether you opt for the accessibility of the 3 Series to the elite luxury of the 7 series. Well designed marriages of turbocharged engines paired and dynamic transmissions are paired with finely-tuned suspensions to deliver a powerful, yet elegant, driving experience worthy of BMW’s well-earned reputation.
One of the best things about buying a BMW is the reliability of the key parts. The higher HP and torque means that you can hit the road without worrying that you are quickly running the motor and trans out. The competitive fuel economy and CO2 numbers make this a great ride in the city and on the freeway.
### 2. Quality interior design
Regardless of which Series and model{} BMW suits you best, there is a built-in reputation of luxury that one expects in a BMW. Whether you’re up-front to experience a well-crafted driving position, or a passenger looking to embrace a sense of elite comfort, you can expect that every one of your expectations will be met.
As a luxury brand, BMW prides itself on cabin design. This is achieved through careful choice of tasteful materials, and diligence throughout every step of cabin assembly. The result is an unparalleled experience, achieved as a result of thoughtful intention and uncompromising execution.
### 3. Innovative Technology
BMW have been a leader in the automotive industry in tech and extends beyond automotive technologies, carrying over to integration of countless amenities, driver assistive and safety features that set the bar for other automakers to aspire to. From heads-up displays to interactive voice and gesture control, BMW is a time-proven pioneer in terms of introducing game-changing technologies which are then adapted by automakers for wider integration.
### 4.Depreciation

New cars drop in value very quickly when you drive them off the lot. On average, a new car will lose 60% of its total value over the 5 five years of its life. That works in your favor if you are buying a car that is 5-6 years old. You might be able to pay close to half price for your BMW if you buy used. From a financial standpoint, buying used makes a lot of sense.
### Finally...
Any vehicle choice comes down to very personal decisions as to what fits the unique demands of your lifestyle and budget. From that vantage point, few options are offered up without a list of considerations to offset the benefits.

## Cons 
### 1:Price
Speaking to every point that has come before this, the old adage “you get what you pay for” certainly applies when buying a BMW. As an aspirational vehicle, a BMW represents a refined automotive palate and a genuine desire to be part of ‘something greater.’
Will you pay more for a BMW than an accessibly-priced domestic offering? Of course. But in doing so, you will secure a more powerful, performance-inspired driving machine, designed to offer luxurious comfort and a wide-range of amenities.
But with a surprising number of buying and leasing options made available, a BMW can be more affordable than one might expect. And with a number of specialty financing programs available, a BMW can be the perfect fit for college students and veterans, as well as an ideal basis for a corporate fleet. Ask more about the buying, leasing and financing options that are available to you, and you may be behind the wheel of a BMW faster than you’d think.
### 2:High Ownership Cost
It's not going to come as a surprise that owning a BMW will run you more than your average car. You'll need premium gasoline, high-end tires, more expensive parts that are imported. You'll also pay more for labor and your synthetic oil change. At the end of the day, BMWs are a the top of the list of most expensive cars to maintain.When you are buying a used BMW you need to consider that these cars have a ton of complicated electronics. That's going to translate to extra labor and parts when repairs are in order.
### 3:Foreign Car
You might not have know that BMW stands for Bayerische Motoren Werke unless you are in German. Yes, BMWs are German automobiles. Owning a foreign car means that you'll be in for specialty repair and maintenance. these costs can add up over time. The repairs on a BMW will be higher than a domestic car, no doubt about it. Your best bet is to choose a mechanic that is experienced with BMWs. However, excellent engineering ensures longer life and good performance for an extended time-frame.

Granted it’s commonly understood that a BMW offers certain assurances in terms of dependability (after all, it IS the ‘Ultimate Driving Machine’). Bavarian automakers are widely applauded for offering superior engineering designed to ensure longer life and more consistent performance. With that in mind, it speaks to reason to that a properly-maintained BMW is less likely to require repair, negating some of the concern that repair costs on a BMW might be higher than that of a lower-priced domestic offering.

### Take note...

If you don’t take care of it it will break, like everything else. Make friends with the local independent BMW shop and fix each problem as it arises. Do NOT defer maintenance. If you let things pile up, it will be a nightmare or to expensive to fix all at once.

Make sure you use PREMIUM GAS all the time. Do NOT let some tell you there is no difference. I find a lot of people with engine problems are the types trying to save 2 to 4$ per tank by using a fuel the car is NOT designed to take. Think or the extra 2–4$ as ongoing maintenance.
