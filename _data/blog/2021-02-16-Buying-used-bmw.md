### Research

The most important step when purchasing a used BMW is DO YOUR RESEARCH. There are several different models with their own trim levels, and depending on the model year, those trim levels may vary, so there’s definitely a lot of details to think about. Starting with BMW 1 Series, this rear-wheel drive four-seater is an ideal choice for consumers specifically looking for a small and fast luxury vehicle. Looking for something a little bigger? The 3 Series is a best-seller and is available in two body styles: sedan or wagon. Some consumers may also wish to consider a luxury midsize sedan, and the BMW 5 Series and 7 series both fit the bill and offer diesel and hybrid options – again, depending on the model year.

When purchasing a used BMW, it’s important to be aware of the depreciation. Yes, BMWs are awesome cars, however like most vehicles, they lose their value quickly. Obviously, the more expensive the vehicle, the longer it takes for the value to depreciate. Another important factor that goes hand-in-hand when looking for an older BMW is the cost of maintenance. BMWs can be more expensive to maintain than non-luxury cars and older model parts can be hard to come by. Remember, luxury vehicles, no matter the year, require higher quality gasoline, oil, and tires than most other vehicles.
### Check The Vehicle’s History
A very important step to consider when purchasing a used BMW is the vehicle’s history. A vehicle history report (VHR) will tell the consumer about the vehicle’s previous owner, accidents, warranties, service, and possible liens. In order to find the VHR, the consumer will need the vehicle identification number (VIN). Once the VIN is located , search online for a free vehicle report. The most reliable VHRs include Carfax, AutoCheck, and the National Motor Vehicle Title Information System (NMVTIS). Important red flags to look out for on a VHR include: tampering with the odometer, major accidents, flood damage to the engine, and any irregularities in the VHR.   

In addition to the VHR, consumers should read about the vehicle’s warranty. If the vehicle does have an existing warranty, verify what’s covered or inquire about possibly extending the warranty, if necessary. Also do your research on which warranties will transfer to the next buyer. Now, let’s say that the BMW is a certified pre-owned vehicle, which means it’s been verified to be in excellent shape. Did you know that BMW offers their own certified pre-owned warranty? Only after the existing New Vehicle Limited Warranty has expired, a BMW Certified Pre-Owned Protection Plan covers the vehicle for one year with unlimited vehicle miles and also includes 5 years of BMW roadside assistance. But there’s a catch – for those vehicles retailed on or after January 1st, 2014, there are various items that are not covered by this protection plan. Those items include: maintenance, upkeep, suspension, body, interior, and all non-original equipment like parts and/or accessories.
###  How long the car has been in use.

How long has the car been used? is the first point to consider. The german machines are heavily engineered and owners are expected to follow the manual strictly. It's paramount to be able to trace how optimally the car was maintained if you are buying from a private seller.
 
###  Average annual maintenance cost.

Owning a BMW can be costly. You have to consider expenses related to maintenance, repairs, fuel, and insurance. Compared to the average automobile, the prices for these and other factors can be higher when owning a BMW.  High-end parts and tires, synthetic oil, and premium gasoline requirements can increase the cost, depending on the series model you choose. Owners can often end up spending thousands of dollars more each year when compared to owning a less expensive car like a Toyota or Honda.

### Get The Best Deal
When considering a used BMW, look up the true market value of the particular model of interest. Based on what dealers are actually retailing the car for and a national average, the true market value tells consumers what other buyers are currently paying for used BMWs. Consumers should consider finding a reliable website that verifies used car pricing – there are several pricing tools that can be easily found online. Now, under the true market value of the used BMW, there are four prices listed that include: Trade-in Value, Private Party, Dealer Retail, and Certified Used Vehicles.

### Common Problems with BMW To check When buying a used bmw car
The engine cooling systems of BMWs tend to have problems frequently. The water pump can fail, and coolant has been known to leak often.

Damage to the cooling system is something that has to be addressed ASAP. Failure to deal with it can cause overheating, which leads to severe engine damage.

The CCV — crankcase ventilation system — can also be problematic. Vacuum leaks can also occur, thanks to cracked hoses. Oil leaks can frequently create a smell of burnt oil emanating from the car’s hood. Fuel pumps and injectors can also falter.

The "Check Engine" light will be triggered when most of these issues occur.

Electronic system issues can arise, too. With there being so many different features, controls, and devices in a BMW, this should come as no surprise. 

Is a BMW Expensive to Fix?
Regular maintenance can extend the lifetime of any car. As a driver, you want your BMW to provide the reliability and safety you need on the road. When you search for a used car, you want to know how expensive it might be to make repairs. This is especially important if you expect to be driving many miles over the car's lifetime. The factory service schedule can give you an idea of how much work will be required to get the best experience out of owning a BMW. But you should consider more frequent maintenance if you want to keep your car in optimal shape.

You should always be on the lookout for common issues that can arise in a car. This can help you take the steps to prevent them ahead of time and avoid more serious problems down the line. If you search for problems early, the repairs you need may end up costing you much less. A responsible driver understands the importance of getting any minor issues checked out as soon as possible. Common issues include overheating or coolant leaks left on your driveway. Every driver should know how to check for leaks as well as coolant and oil levels.

Tires must be kept properly inflated, especially on all-wheel-drive BMWs. Make sure you check the specs for your car. Depending on the series model, the pressure required for the front tires may be different than the pressure required for the rear tires. If you notice any jolting when stopping or speeding up, your tire pressure levels may be off.

These and other issues are factors that will impact the cost of fixing your used BMW. But many things will determine your lifetime repair costs, including the series model of your car, the amount of use, and the road conditions you encounter when driving.
