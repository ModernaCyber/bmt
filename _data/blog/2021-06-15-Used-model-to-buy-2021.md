## What used BMW model should I buy?
Buying a used BMW is one of the smartest ways to get the features you're looking for cheaply for a luxury car. But you need to know what to look for when buying a used vehicle. Failing to do your research or overlooking the hidden costs of owning a car can cause you to pay more than you expected in the long run.
When buying a used BMW car, there is a lot to look for than just the price factor.
### The 2017 BMW X1
BMW X1 ranks at the top of the luxury sub-compact SUV class cars. It has robust engine horsepower and the handling of a sports car. Inside the cabin, there’s an intuitive system that feels up to date, even in 2021. With great fuel economy that ranges all the way up to an astounding 34 mpg on the highway, there's no excuse not to experience the luxury and phenomenally balanced driving experience of a BMW X1.
### The 2019 BMW X5
The BMW X5 is one of the most popular BMW models on the market, it offers premium luxury, paired with unprecedented power delivery— with horsepower topping out at 567 on the fastest trims available for purchase. The 2020 BMW X5 is an engineering achievement , that w won't disappoint most drivers, and the savings available (between 10 and 30 thousand dollars depending on the features) are definitely something to get excited about.
### 2017 BMW 5 Series
The sedan cousin to the X5 SUV, the 5 Series is a five-seater sedan that's got some heft under the hood. As BMW's middle offering in terms of size and speed, the 5 Series is an unbelievably smooth drive. The handling is so smooth too. With gas-pressurized shock absorbers and an average fuel economy that can reach into the '30s, the 5 Series should be the first choice for anyone looking to buy a used luxury vehicle.

### The 2019 BMW X2
It's smaller than the X5 and X1, it is still a great compact SUV with fantastic features like lane departure warning and Apple CarPlay integration. The 2020 X2 boasts a 2.0L 4-Cylinder DOHC 16V TwinPower Turbo with 228-302 horsepower. The reason we picked a 2019 as our favorite X2, was because this was the year the M35i trim was introduced. This performance-focused trim was a game-changer for the X2, and we highly recommend it for those looking for a little more power out of their compact SUV.

### The 2015 BMW 3 Series
The 3 Series is pretty much synonymous with performance in America. Depending on the model you get your hands on, it's likely you'll find a super-fast, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that puts out somewhere in the neighborhood of 200 horsepower. With prices so low on vehicles like the 3 Series, plenty of drivers should spend a lot of time asking themselves whether they'd rather a brand new compact or an asphalt-devouring sports luxury vehicle for the exact same price.
