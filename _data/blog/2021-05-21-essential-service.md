# Most Important Service Items
It’s inevitable that you’ll have to take your BMW to the workshop from time to time. However, its recommended to take your BMW vehicle for regular repair by a professional to help avoid costly emergency services later. You’ll also keep your car running better, faster  and longer.
###  Engine

Your car’s engine is the car; it keeps your car going. With any sort of engine problems, you face a risk of danger, your car will not function at its optimal level, or your car will be rendered useless. i.e. even small engine issues can equal BIG problems at some point. Have your engine checked a few times a year. At the same time, have your transmission checked.

###  Brakes
BMW’s brakes are essential, They are the thin blue line in safety. Checking your brakes should be a regular basic car maintenance. Here’s where the assistance of a  professional mechanic is extra important as well as necessary. BMW repair expert recommends flushing the brake system every two years or so.
This is because brake fluid is hydroscopic, absorbs moisture from the air. Over time, this dangerously contaminates the brake fluid, eventually leading to brake system failures. Another thing to have your mechanic look at at the same time are your brake pads preventing that annoying squeaking and other problems.
###  Tires
Not only do they physically get you where you need to go, but they are key to safety and to maximizing your fuel economy. Faulty or damaged tires are a major cause of car accidents in the around the globe.
The slightest tire problem can easily turn into a big issue. Tires should always be properly inflated; air should be put in as often as needed. Check your tire pressure at least twice per month, or ideally once a week. 
Additionally, your tires must be rotated every so often. Rotating tires means moving them from one side of the car to the other. This is done because tires tend to wear unevenly—front tires tend to wear on the outside edges whereas the rear wheels, which simply follow the front, wear down more evenly. However, if you don’t rotate your tires, your front tires will wear down much faster than the rest, eventually forcing you to replace them thousands of miles sooner than you otherwise might have to. We recommend taking in your BMW for a tire rotation at least every 6 months, or every 3000 to 6000 miles.
###  Cooling system
The cooling system is an extremely important part of your BMW. The primary function is to cool down the engine and maintain an ideal operating temperature. In order to prevent an overheated car, you should flush your system with engine coolant, which has lubrication properties that keep the water pump, thermostat, and other internal components from seizing. Your cooling system should be flushed every 3 years.
###  Transmission
Its recommended to flushing the transmission every 50K miles instead. It’s much more efficient to regularly service the transmission fluid and filter than to pay the cost of replacing a transmission. Similarly, flush the transfer case, front differential, and rear differential every 50K miles. You’ll be paying about 1/20th the cost this way.
### Steering system
The steering system affects ability to control your BMW vehicle, making it an essential component of your safety. To keep it in good shape, we recommend flushing the power steering fluid system once every 50K miles. Power steering fluid breaks down over time and the fluid becomes contaminated. This can cause leaks and other failures.
###  Oil
Regularly changing your oil is one of the most important things you can do for your car’s health. It can potentially save you from shelling out thousands to an auto shop later on. The BMW Owner Manual recommends changing oil every 12,000 to 15,000 miles. However, this results in carbon build up in your car’s intake valves, which can lead to serious problems.
We recommend changing oil every 5000 miles to help prevent this. 5000 miles may seem too soon, but 5000-mile oil changes will help bring your BMW vehicles to a ripe old age. Plus, cars driving in hot climates needs their oil changed more frequently. Oil changes are something you can do relatively easily by yourself. Also, don’t forget your oil filters! They too need changing on a regular basis.
