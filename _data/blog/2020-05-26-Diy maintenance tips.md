#  DIY BMW Maintenance Tips
Most people aren’t technically trained or skilled enough to get down on their knees with some tools and service their car themselves but, ultimately, the person responsible for the health of your BMW vehicle is you. 
### 1. Keep it dark. 
 It can be hard to find shade in the blistering Austin summers, but try to park your vehicle in the shade wherever possible. The UV rays found in the sun can cause damage to the interior and exterior of your car over time. It’s also a good idea to keep a car shade in the windshield of your car.
###  2. Keep your car clean.
 Both the inside and outside. Keeping your car clean not only makes it look better, it keeps it running better, too. How? Dirt and other particles can cause damage to the delicate components of your vehicle. A dirty car may also have a psychological impact, causing you to unconsciously treat your car more poorly than you otherwise might.

### 3. Protect your leather.
 If your car has a leather interior, it’s important to keep it clean and treated. While leather is durable, it can still experience wear and tear, and cracked or otherwise worn leather can quickly start looking tacky. Keep leather seats safe with a cover or protector
### 4. Wax your car. 
 You can do this yourself or have the guys at the carwash do it for you. Regularly waxing your BMW vehicle not only keeps it looking great, but wards off rust.
### 5. Check your tire treads. 
Tires wear down over time. Check your tire tread regularly to see if its time to replace your tires or not. You can easily doing this by placing a penny in the tread of your tire. If the tire doesn’t reach the top of Lincoln’s head, it may be time for new tires.
### 6. Clear your lenses. 
Are your BMW’s headlights starting to look dull and worn? Did you know that you can easily get new, shiny-looking lights? You can pick up a headlight restoration kit for less than $30, and they are extremely easy to use. Within minutes, you can turn your dull and yellowed headlights new, improving illumination and making your car look that much nicer!
### 7. Run errands all at once. 
Vehicles work best when their engines are already warmed off. Making short trips, forcing you to constantly turn your vehicle on and off, adds extra, unnecessary wear on your vehicle. Whenever possible, try to carry out tasks and errands all at once, so that you can avoid making a trip on a cold engine.
### 8. Drive carefully. 
Aggressive, fast, or otherwise careless drivers may enjoy their wild driving styles, but the rowdy fun comes at a price. Accelerating quickly, stopping suddenly, taking tight corners, or driving in any sort of jerky, unsanctioned fashion will lead to way more wear and tear on your vehicle. Ultimately, that results in more frequent maintenance and higher repair bills.
### 9. Buy clean gas.
BMW vehicles are high performance machines that demands quality fuel. Fuel ranges in purity and effectiveness. Reputable gas stations have their gas filtered at the pump and the pump filters changed regularly. Low quality stations won’t have filters, leaving you with dirty gasoline. It’s worth picking a station or brand you trust and sticking with it.
Another thing to watch out for: the tanker. If you happen to see a gasoline tanker filling up at your local station, you may want to come back another day or go to another station. Why? The turbulence of the newly pumped gas can stir up sediment in the station’s underground tanks. Sediment in your gas can dirty and clog up fuel filters and injectors, resulting in poor performance and possible future repairs.
### 10. Keep an auto log.
 This sounds like a lot of work, but it’s actually quite simple and worth the effort. Keep a small pad of paper and a pen in your glove compartment and use them to record your gas fill-ups and gas mileage. If your gas mileage changes or worsens, it may be an early warning sign, letting you know that, at the least, you should go see a mechanic.
